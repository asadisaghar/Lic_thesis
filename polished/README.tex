\subsection{Common \LaTeX{} Math Symbols}
There are a multitude of mathematical symbols available for \LaTeX{} and it would take a great effort to learn the commands for them all. The most common ones you are likely to use are shown on this page:\\

You can use this page as a reference or crib sheet, the symbols are rendered as large, high quality images so you can quickly find the \LaTeX{} command for the symbol you need.

\subsection{\LaTeX{} on a Mac}
 
The \LaTeX{} package is available for many systems including Windows, Linux and Mac OS X. The package for OS X is called MacTeX and it contains all the applications you need -- bundled together and pre-customised -- for a fully working \LaTeX{} environment and workflow.
 
MacTeX includes a dedicated \LaTeX{} IDE (Integrated Development Environment) called ``TeXShop'' for writing your `\texttt{.tex}' files and ``BibDesk'': a program to manage your references and create your bibliography section just as easily as managing songs and creating playlists in iTunes.
